## Introduction - Functional Programming

* What's that FP thing?
  - Computation => mathematical function evaluation, mapping input to output
  - Focus on immutability, reproducibility
  - Origins in Lambda Calculus (1930s)
* Have you heard of FP?
  - Clojure
  - Erlang/Elixir
  - Haskell
  - Lisp
  - OCaml
  - Scala
  - ...

???

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus (yes, that's where the "lamdba"
  in "lamdba function" comes from)

---

## Introduction - From Ruby to Haskell

* Blown away at ZuriHac; didn't understand a thing

![ZuriHac 2017](./zurihac.png)

* Interviewed for Ruby job, got Haskell job
* Now working with Tweag I/O, R&D lab in Paris

![Tweag I/O](./logo-tweag.png)

* Apply functional programming for HPC, distributed systems, SaaS, data processing

## A Fully Functional Webapp - API as Types

``` haskell
-- interface/Types.hs
type WebstersAPI =
  -- GET /websters
  -- returns a list of "Webster"s
  "websters"                            :> Get '[JSON] [Webster] :<|>
  -- POST /websters
  -- inserts a "Webster" and returns a list of "Webster"s
  "websters" :> ReqBody '[JSON] Webster :> Post '[JSON] [Webster]

-- | The datastructure representing a "Webster"
data Webster = Webster
  { name :: Text
  } deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)


-- Tell the compiler that it's free to implement the JSON encoding and
-- decoding of "Webster" in whatever way it wants
instance ToJSON Webster
instance FromJSON Webster
```

???

* Comments start with `--`, much like SQL

* There are three components:
  - [interface](https://github.com/nmattia/webzuri-fully-functional-webapp/tree/master/interface),
    which specifies the types used by both the backend and the frontend, and of
    course the
  - [backend](https://github.com/nmattia/webzuri-fully-functional-webapp/tree/master/backend) and the
  - [frontend](https://github.com/nmattia/webzuri-fully-functional-webapp/tree/master/frontend)

* Type: information that you share with the compiler
  - Used in Go, Java, Rust, C
  - In its most basic form, prevents mixing incompatible structures

* In Haskell, the compiler can do much more with that information, like
  specifying an API with [servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant).
  This is not a native ability but is encoded in a library.

* Haskell "Datatype" (like `Webster`) is basically a Java "class" or a Go
  "struct".

* JSON deriving: performed by [aeson](https://github.com/bos/aeson/), also a
  library

## A Fully Functional Webapp - Serving an API

  "websters" :> ReqBody '[JSON] Webster :> Post '[JSON] [Webster]

``` haskell
-- backend/Main.hs

-- Function body
main = do
  -- read CLI arguments
  [webappPath] <- getArgs

  -- create a reference containing an empty list ([])
  websters <- newIORef []

  -- run our webapp "webstersApp" (see next slide)
  run 8081 (webstersApp websters webappPath)
```

???

* Very imperative so far: we'll use the server to serve the frontend code as
  well. We take the path to the frontend assets as an argument, then we create a
  mutable reference containing an empty list (of websters).
* Then we run `webstersApp` (on port 8081)

???

* Something you've seen a thousand times: a function signature, and a function
  body. Note that we can define mini-functions below the `where` keyword.

* First `webstersGet`: our API type specifies that it should return a list of
  `Webster`s. So we simply read the reference. Haskell, like Ruby, is
  expression based: no need for `return` or the like.

* Then the `webstersPost` handler: The API specifies that the request body will
  contain one new webster, so we add it to the list of websters we already have
  in the mutable reference. The API also specifies that a list of websters must
  be returned: we read the reference. Done.

* In both functions above, the compiler would complain if we forgot to use the
  argument or returned an object of incorrect type. Note that all the JSON
  encoding/decoding is handled for us, derived from the API.

* We combine those two handlers together, alongside `serveDirectory`, which
  serves everything at the path we read from the command line (our frontend
  assets).

* Note the weird `Proxy` thing: this is a dummy value that only contains type
  information so that we can tell `serve` what API we actually want to serve.

* Two functions are generated for us by `client`: `webstersGet` and
  `webstersPost`. They are basically callbacks the perform the requests for us.
  The former returns a list of websters, while the latter takes new webster and
  uploads it to the server (and returns the new list of websters).

* We register two triggers:
  - `webstersGetTrigger` (attached to a button) which performs a "GET" request.
  - `webstersPostTrigger` (attached to a text input) which performs a "POST"
    request.
  Note that the types must match: a button (that carry no information besides
  "I was clicked") to trigger a GET, and a text input (that we read as the
  webster's name) for the POST. Otherwise the compiler would complain.

* We bind the `websters` widget to whichever list of websters was updated last.

* For each `webster` in `websters` we create a text element.

* That's all. Really. No json encoding/decoding. No specifying the URL. All
  that is derived from the `WebstersAPI` type.

* Two functions are generated for us by `client`: `webstersGet` and
  `webstersPost`. They are basically callbacks the perform the requests for us.
  The former returns a list of websters, while the latter takes new webster and
  uploads it to the server (and returns the new list of websters).

* We register two triggers:
  - `webstersGetTrigger` (attached to a button) which performs a "GET" request.
  - `webstersPostTrigger` (attached to a text input) which performs a "POST"
    request.
  Note that the types must match: a button (that carry no information besides
  "I was clicked") to trigger a GET, and a text input (that we read as the
  webster's name) for the POST. Otherwise the compiler would complain.

## A Fully Functional Webapp - Build and Deploy with Nix

* Nix is a purely functional package manager
* A Big (Turing complete) Json File

``` nix
{
  x = 123;
  text = "Hello";
  y = f { bla = 456; };
}
```
* Everything is immutable (written to read-only `/nix/store`)

``` shell
$ ls /nix/store | grep nodejs
7id2b12px852x213zfq9dskmkcyss33z-nodejs-4.4.6
gf5hf3mmz840dkldpajv1f4hyp6w1jv3-nodejs-6.9.5
mbanw5y2pg5hz6rvvdfpdcl81y7b6qc4-nodejs-slim-6.9.5
mrbqf0k3i060gkfl1j0l5phshkjgwrjw-nodejs-slim-6.9.5
pri4d48v6jzk1zb27daw91lpn3zf7v2n-nodejs-6.9.5
yh5nnld1fk56xsmirkkm6aw4xbz150f2-nodejs-6.11.1
z5prbgja9fkzs35bpkak5d5n67zzlc7z-nodejs-6.9.1
```

???

* Nix is a full-blown programming language. Read more about it
  [here](https://nixos.org/nix/) or read a [quick
  tutorial](https://medium.com/@MrJamesFisher/nix-by-example-a0063a1a4c55).

* However it really shines when it comes to package (and dependency)
  management.

* Works on Linux, MacOS, probably more. All the dependencies (and outputs) are
  stored in a flat directory, the `/nix/store`, so it is distribution agnostic.

* An entry in the store is immutable and tagged with a hash. The hash depends
  on _all_ the build inputs (scripts you used to build, etc). If a single build
  input changes, you get a new hash, and a new entry in the store.

* The whole set of nix packages is a big nix program. It is plain text,
  described in a [repo](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) on GitHub.

---
## A Fully Functional Webapp - Build and Deploy with Nix

* Programmatically describe build

``` shell
  frontend = ghcjsWithInterface.callPackage ./frontend/default.nix { };
  backend = ghcWithInterface.callPackage ./backend/default.nix { } ;
  server-exe = pkgs.writeScript "server"
      ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash

      ${backend}/bin/wzuri-backend ${frontend}/bin/wzuri-frontend.jsexe
      '';
```

* Expand store paths

``` shell
$ cat $(nix-build -A server-exe)
#!/usr/bin/env bash

/nix/store/e8../bin/wzuri-backend /nix/store/31../bin/wzuri-frontend.jsexe
```

???

* The whole build process for the webzuri webapp is described using nix,
  relying on the various nix packages (libraries, really). Here I define an
  extra step that takes the build outputs of the frontend and backend and
  combine them together in a nifty script.

## Starting easy - One function at a time

* Reuse your code written in Java, R, C, ...

``` haskell
C.include "<stdio.h>"

readAndSum :: CInt -> IO CInt
readAndSum n  = [C.block| int
  {
    int i, sum = 0, tmp;
    for (i = 0; i < $(int n); i++) {
      scanf("%d", &tmp);
      sum += tmp;
    }
    return sum;
  } |]

main :: IO ()
main = withJVM [] $ do
    x <- readAndSum 5
    message <- reflect ("Result from C: " <> pack (show x))
    [java|
      {
        javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, $message);
      }
    |]
```

???

* There are many ways you can go about starting with functional programming.
  Some languages like Scala mix both imperative and functional programming. With
  Haskell as well you can start slowly: write imperative code, but in a
  functional language. Super easy!

* Or even better, reuse you own imperative language libraries by calling them
  from Haskell, using [inline-java](https://github.com/tweag/inline-java),
  [inline-c](https://github.com/fpco/inline-c),
  [inline-r](https://tweag.github.io/HaskellR/)...

## Starting easy - Build the WebZuri webapp!


* `$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh`
* clone [nmattia/webzuri-fully-functional-webapp](https://github.com/nmattia/webzuri-fully-functional-webapp)
* `$(nix-build -A serve-slides)`

``` shell
 python = pkgs.python35.withPackages (ps: [ ps.httpserver ]);
 serve-slides = pkgs.writeScript "slides"
     ''
     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     cd ${./slides}
     ${python}/bin/python -m http.server
     '';
```

* If it doesn't build, beer is on me
